Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP 
requests in web applications. It is often used in Vue.js applications 
to communicate with a backend server or external APIs. Axios provides 
a simple and consistent API for sending and receiving HTTP requests.


In Laravel, the back() method is commonly used to redirect a user 
back to the previous page, typically after they have submitted a form or 
interacted with a web application. The withSuccess() method is not a built-in
 Laravel method, but it's likely being used to flash a success message to the 
session before 
redirecting the user back to a specific page.
